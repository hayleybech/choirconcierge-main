Dear {{ $owner->name }},

I'm Hayley Bech, the creator of Choir Concierge, and I wanted to personally thank you for signing up to a free trial of our choir management software.

This software is truly a labor of love for me, born from my experiences as a choir director and my passion for music.

For over two decades, music has been the constant thread that brings meaning to my life - from over a decade performing in lead roles in local musical theatre companies to 11+ years of singing in award-winning choirs with Barbershop Harmony Australia. Along the way, I've worn many hats: singer, coach, Director/AMD, and even founder of my own vocal coaching business.

Over this time, I've also seen firsthand how admin tasks can steal time from what we all love most: making music. That's how my two passions - music and technology - collided. With over a decade of experience as a software developer, I realised I could create something to help choirs focus more on the joy of singing and less on administrative headaches.

That's why for the past 7+ years, I've poured my heart into developing Choir Concierge. My goal has always been to create a tool that I wish I'd had all those years ago - something that truly understands what choirs need, a tool that's both powerful and *incredibly simple to use*.

**Your support means the world to me. You're not just using a product; you're helping to bring a dream to life.**

I hope Choir Concierge exceeds your expectations and makes your choir management experience smoother and more enjoyable.

If you need any help getting started or encounter any issues, please don't hesitate to email me directly at [hayley@choirconcierge.com](hayley@choirconcierge.com).

I'll do my absolute best to assist you promptly. However, I want to be transparent - as Choir Concierge is a passion project I work on outside of my regular job, there may sometimes be a delay in my response. I appreciate your understanding and patience.

Thank you again for your support. I truly hope you'll love using Choir Concierge as much as I have loved creating it for you.

Happy singing!
