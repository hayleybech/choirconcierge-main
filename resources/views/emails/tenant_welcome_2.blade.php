Hi {{ $owner->name }},

Hayley here from Choir Concierge. It's been a week since you started your free trial, and I wanted to touch base to see how things are going.

I'm genuinely curious:
1. How are you finding Choir Concierge so far?
2. Did the setup process go smoothly for you?
3. Is there anything you need help with?

Remember, your feedback and questions are invaluable to me. They not only help you get the most out of your 30-day trial but also contribute to making Choir Concierge even better for choir leaders like yourself.

If you're facing any challenges or have questions, please don't hesitate to reach out. You can:
- Reply directly to this email, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
- Book a personalised demo where we can walk through any aspects of the software you'd like to explore further. You can schedule that [here](https://calendly.com/hayleybech/30min).

Your success with Choir Concierge matters to me. Whether you're sailing smoothly or encountering rough waters, I'm here to support you.

Looking forward to hearing about your experience!

Warm regards,

Hayley Bech
